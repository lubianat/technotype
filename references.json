    "abstract": "Cell type identification is essential for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies, currently transforming the life sciences. CHETAH (CHaracterization of cEll Types Aided by Hierarchical classification) is an accurate cell type identification algorithm that is rapid and selective, including the possibility of intermediate or unassigned categories. Evidence for assignment is based on a classification tree of previously available scRNA-seq reference data and includes a confidence score based on the variance in gene expression per cell type. For cell types represented in the reference data, CHETAH’s accuracy is as good as existing methods. Its specificity is superior when cells of an unknown type are encountered, such as malignant cells in tumor samples which it pinpoints as intermediate or unassigned. Although designed for tumor samples in particular, the use of unassigned and intermediate types is also valuable in other exploratory studies. This is exemplified in pancreas datasets where CHETAH highlights cell populations not well represented in the reference dataset, including cells with profiles that lie on a continuum between that of acinar and ductal cell types. Having the possibility of unassigned and intermediate cell types is pivotal for preventing misclassification and can yield important biological information for previously unexplored tissues.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) quantifies the gene expression of individual cells in a sample, which allows distinct cell-type populations to be identified and characterized. An important step in many scRNA-seq analysis pipelines is the classification of cells into known cell-types. While this can be achieved using experimental techniques, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, these approaches are impractical for large numbers of cells. This motivates the development of data-driven cell-type identification methods. We find limitations with current approaches due to the reliance on known marker genes and sensitivity to the quality of reference samples. Here we present a computationally light statistical approach, based on Naive Bayes, that leverages public datasets to combine information across thousands of genes and probabilistically assign cell-type identity. Using datasets ranging across species and tissue types, we demonstrate that our approach is robust to low-quality reference data and produces more accurate cell-type identification than current methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n          Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is widely used for analyzing gene expression in multi-cellular systems and provides unprecedented access to cellular heterogeneity. scRNA-seq experiments aim to identify and quantify all cell types present in a sample. Measured single-cell transcriptomes are grouped by similarity and the resulting clusters are mapped to cell types based on cluster-specific gene expression patterns. While the process of generating clusters has become largely automated, annotation remains a laborious ad-hoc effort that requires expert biological knowledge. Here, we introduce CellMeSH - a new automated approach to identifying cell types based on prior literature. CellMeSH combines a database of gene-cell type associations with a probabilistic method for database querying. The database is constructed by automatically linking gene and cell type information from millions of publications using existing indexed literature resources. Compared to manually constructed databases, CellMeSH is more comprehensive and scales automatically. The probabilistic query method enables reliable information retrieval even though the gene-cell type associations extracted from the literature are necessarily noisy. CellMeSH achieves up to 60% top-1 accuracy and 90% top-3 accuracy in annotating the cell types on a human dataset, and up to 58.8% top-1 accuracy and 88.2% top-3 accuracy on three mouse datasets, which is consistently better than existing approaches.\r\n          \r\n            Availability\r\n            \r\n              Web server:\r\n              https://uncurl.cs.washington.edu/db_query\r\n              and API:\r\n              https://github.com/shunfumao/cellmesh",

    "abstract": "Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the \"random effects\" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to consider the generalizability of one's conclusions from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.",

    "abstract": "The recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling has catalyzed a growing sense in the scientific community that the time is ripe to complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the human body. The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the principles governing neuronal diversity is a fundamental goal for neuroscience. Here, we provide an anatomical and transcriptomic database of nearly 200 genetically identified cell populations. By separately analyzing the robustness and pattern of expression differences across these cell populations, we identify two gene classes contributing distinctly to neuronal diversity. Short homeobox transcription factors distinguish neuronal populations combinatorially, and exhibit extremely low transcriptional noise, enabling highly robust expression differences. Long neuronal effector genes, such as channels and cell adhesion molecules, contribute disproportionately to neuronal diversity, based on their patterns rather than robustness of expression differences. By linking transcriptional identity to genetic strains and anatomical atlases, we provide an extensive resource for further investigation of mouse neuronal cell types.",

The recent advent of single-cell transcriptional profiling using RNA sequencing is producing 'big data', enabling the identification of novel human cell types at an unprecedented rate. In this review, we summarize recent work characterizing cell types in the human central nervous and immune systems using single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing, and discuss the implications that these discoveries are having on the representation of cell types in the reference Cell Ontology (CL). We propose a method, based on random forest machine learning, for identifying sets of necessary and sufficient marker genes, which can be used to assemble consistent and reproducible cell type definitions for incorporation into the CL. The representation of defined cell type classes and their relationships in the CL using this strategy will make the cell type classes being identified by high-throughput/high-content technologies findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR), allowing the CL to serve as a reference knowledgebase of information about the role that distinct cellular phenotypes play in human health and disease.",

RegNum is an associated online database for Phylogenic names.The PhyloCode proposes to regulate phylogenetic nomenclature by providing rules for how to decide which associations of names and definitions will be considered established, which of those will be considered homonyms or synonyms, and which one of a set of synonyms or homonyms will be considered accepted (generally the one registered first; see below). The PhyloCode will only allow the naming of clades, not of paraphyletic or polyphyletic groups, and will only allow the use of specimens, species, and apomorphies as specifiers (anchors).",

# Logical consequences of the definition


One notable logical consequence of the proposed set of criteria is that the definition of a "cell state" is left aside. For the pragmatic purpose adopted here, I  avoid dissecting dissection of the differences between persistent classes of cells (which I refer to as "traditional cell types") or the transient, fugacious classes of cells (which I refer to as the "traditional cell state"). Even though such a  definition is an important topic for theoretical research, it is not strictly necessary for the framework presented here. 

One example implication of this entailment is that the class "human cells in metaphase of mitosis" can be considered a cell type, as they can be rigorously defined and are restricted to a taxon. Even though "metaphase" itself is still a  biological process, we can describe all cells executing this process as from a single cell type. 

However, does a dividing fibroblast stop being a fibroblast, even if temporarily? Again, I do not aim to answer this in a philosophical-ontological sense. Pragmatically, if the rigorous definition used (e.g., expression of a marker) still holds during duplication, this cell can be assigned to two disjunct classes: "fibroblasts" and "doubling cells"! It is, thus, essential to consider that cells can belong to at least two disjunct classes. 

Often, cell types are described taxonomically, as being related in one single hierarchy. Cells can be assigned to disjunct classes. Thus, it is not possible to annotate cell types with a single identifier using a taxonomic tree, in which each concept is represented by a single node with one (and only one) direct parent node. Cell types need to be represented ontologically (in the computational sense), which can be thought of multiple, intertwining taxonomies, taking into account different ways of classifying cells. 

Another logical consequence of the definition is that concepts of "subtype" become redundant with "cell type." A "subtype," then, is a concept that only makes sense when talking about classes with different degrees of universality. Thus, claims to discover new cell "subtypes" or "types" differ only stylistically and can be considered indistinguishable in the perspective of research synthesis.

# Logical consequences of the definition of a cell type


One notable logical consequence of the proposed set of criteria is that the definition of a cell state is left as a subclass for cell type. For the pragmatic purpose adopted here, we avoid the dissection of the differences between persistent classes of cells (which we refer to as traditional cell types) or the transient, fugacious classes of cells (which we refer to as traditional cell states). Even though such a distinction is an important topic for theoretical research, it is not a requirement for representing biomedical experiments.

One example of this entailment is that the class “human cells in metaphase of mitosis” can be considered a cell type, as they can be explicitly defined and restricted to a taxon. Even though “metaphase” itself is a biological process, we can describe all cells executing this process as a singular cell class (here a synonym of cell type).

However, does a dividing fibroblast stop being a fibroblast, even if temporarily? Again, we do not aim to answer this in a philosophical-ontological sense. Pragmatically, if the explicit definition used for fibroblast (e.g., expression of a marker) still holds during duplication, this cell can be assigned to two classes that are not hierarchically related: “fibroblasts” and “doubling cells”. If cells can be assigned to multiple classes that are not hierarchically related, it is not possible to annotate cell types with a single identifier using a taxonomic tree, in which each concept is represented by a single node with one (and only one) direct parent node. This is in conflict with attempts to classify cell-types using single hierarchies in the form of a tree [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz543] [@doi:10.7554/eLife.38619] [@doi:10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100616-060818].  Cell types need to be represented ontologically (in the computational sense), which can be thought of as multiple, intertwining trees that take into account different ways of classifying cells (Figure @fig:notatree).

Another logical consequence of the definition is that the concept of subtype becomes redundant with the concept of cell type. The notion of subtype, then, only makes sense when discussing classes with different degrees of universality. Thus, claims to discovery of new cell “subtypes” or “types” differ only stylistically and can be considered indistinguishable from the perspective of research synthesis.

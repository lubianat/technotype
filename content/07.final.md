# Final remarks

In this article, I proposed a set of 3 rules (rigourous description,taxon scope restriction and theoretical usefulness) and 1 recommendation (link to ontology of cell types) to pragmatically define classes of cells (cell types). I then followed to propose 4 namings to clarify discussions on the topic: archetypes (a class with a scope above species level), \textit{stricto sensu} cell types (a class with scope equal to  one species), infratypes (a class with scope below the species level) and technotypes (the exact cell type defined for an experimental setup).

In the following sections I dissected some logical entailments of such definition, which might conflic with current view on definitions of cell types. I do not aim at solving such conflicts, but merely propose this as one, out of many possible ways, of organizing our knowledge about cell types. Of note, I would like to highlight the concept of the "technotype" as representing the unit for cell classification, in an analogous way of how the "species" is the unit for evolutionary biology. 

This article is intended to clarify some of the meanings, and provide directions to future development of the theoretical basis of cell type definition. The discussion on the definition of cell types is still on its infancy, and we need human power to tackle the huge theoretical challenges. Biologists, philosophers and computer scientists ought to distill the details of defining cell types, powering the Human Cell Atlas and the life sciences research enterprise of this century.

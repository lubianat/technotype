# Naming classes of cell types


In parallel to the criteria raised on part 1,I propose a set of naming conventions for different classes of cell types, to facilitate communication. Much of the literature mixes cell types in one species (e.g., when dealing with a cell type as an evolutionary unit) and multispecies (e.g., in the cell ontology). It is arguably useful to distill these different concepts into their own names.. Given the importance of the concept of species in biological classification [@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhyloCode] [@http://phylonames.org/code/divisions/1/], we derive a "species-centric" view on the naming of classes of cell types. The three classes we propose are: 

- Archetypes, for when the _taxonomic scope_ of the type is beyond the level of species. For example, "mammal neutrophils." 
- _Stricto sensu_ cell types, for when the _taxonomic scope_ of the type corresponds to a single species. For example, "human neutrophils."
- Infratypes, for when the _taxonomic scope_ is below the level of species. For example, considering the mouse strain "C57BL/6J" [@https://www.jax.org/strain/000664], "C57BL/6J neutrophils".

 By adopting a more precise vocabulary, we can flesh out misunderstandings and communicate clearly. At the level of individual scientific experiments, we usually work at the "infratype" level: the samples come only from a subpopulation of the species of interest, and cannot be assumed to be "randomly sampled" from all individuals. This has important practical considerations for, once more, avoiding failing implicitly for the problem of induction. 

In addition, in individual experiments, we work with cells of very specific classes. They are not only infratypes, but very specific infratypes, defined by non-random research setups and pragmatic choices. For example, we might call "CD4 T cells" what are actually CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ cells from the axillary lymph node of 2-month-old chow-fed female C57BL6/J mice from the mouse-house of the Institute of Biochemistry of the University of SÃ£o Paulo collected in several mornings around 10 pm. Albeit really specific, all the mentioned facets (markers, anatomical location, age, biological sex, strain, housing conditions, circadian clock and diet) are known to alter what we know about cell types. Thus, we benefit from using a name for these very specific classes: 

- Technotype: A specific, experimentally defined cell type, which harbors on its definitions the precise conditions of the cells sampled. 

Even if really specific, a technotype is still a class. Unless a study used only one single-cell, it likely contained some sampling method. Samples are sampled from a specific population, for which hypothesis are actually tested. This is the most "granular' cell type in our pragmatic view for research synthesis. This is the type that can be strictly annotated in single-cell RNA-seq analysis, for example. 

Single claims are made and tested for technotypes, and the claims can be logically combined in "upper" ontological levels for making claims with a higher degree of universality. The propagation of knowledge to upper levels cannot be implicit. (see Yarkoni 2020 for an analogous problem in the psychological sciences [@doi:10.31234/osf.io/jqw35]). As defended by Popper, knowledge should travel "quasi-inductionally" by fostering hypothesis with higher degrees of generality, which can then be tested for the more universal class [@isbn:9788531612503].

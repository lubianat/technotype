# A set of 3 + 1 rules for defining a cell type

In an opinion article published in Cell Systems in 2017, prominent researchers presented their views on  the "Conceptual Definition of ‘‘Cell Type’’in the Context of a Mature Organism?" If one consensus could be reached is that the task is widely open. From ditching the concept altogether, to conceptually exploring \textit{C. elegans}(a species in which we know the exact number and place of each cell expect in an adult) to ecological definitions of cell types, the work makes it clear how hard it is to find rules that would please all the community. Many advocate for a core role of the cells'function in defining cell types, a slippery road, as the meaning of "function" in biology is elusive. 

Aevermann et al (2018) come up with a set of rules to classifiy samples in  single cell RNA-Seq, based on consisted  of "The minimum set of necessary and sufficient marker genes selectively expressed by the cell type", "A parent cell class in the CL", and "A specimen source description (anatomic structure þ species)." This conceptual advance is pratically important, solving many of the issues raised before by Bakken et al (2017) and others. The Cell Ontology also has used gene and protein markers as descriptors for defining cell types.   

The use of markers, however, leaves us with a conceptual problem, when we want find a global definitions: definitions of cell type used by electrophysiologists, or even in the Kuhnian manuals of histology classes, are not based on markers. Rigorously, this would leave aside a whole part of what we consider biomedical knowledge. Moreover, markers are not, strictu sensu, defined for cell types that span multiple species, requiring us ton consider homology. This adds an extra layer of confusion that will be adressed partially in Part 2. 

My pragmatic definition of cell type (for eukaryotic, multicellular organisms) consists in 3+1 simple rules. A cell type is any class of cells which must be:
- Rigorously defined
- Theoretically useful 
- Identifiable for a defined taxon

And that should be:
- Logically related to other cell types

In the following paragraphs, I will clarify the meaning and motivation of the rules.

For rule 1, by "rigorously defined", I mean that a cell can be identified as belonging or not to the class given a set of criteria and we should be able to identify a cell from its cell type in any individual that matches the rigorous criteria. An example of such a rigorous criteria is "expression of the CD3 protein, expression of the CD4 protein, lack of expression of the CD8 protein." This implies the need for using rigorous definitions of what is a "CD3 protein" and what "expression" means, but it is feasible to have nominal definitions. Actually, in practice, similar criteria are used in immunology for defining cell types. 

Rule number 2  is a speficicaton of a  rigourousness: one rigorousness criteria is to define the taxons in which a given cell type is expected to have manifestations. I will call this set of taxons the \textit{scope} of the cell type.

Knowing the scope is inmportance to avoid the pitfalls of assuming that theories corroborrated with mice experiments are valid for other organisms. This is an instance of the classic problem of induction, which subsists much of the core arguments of Logic of Scientific Discovery. An speficication of the defined would make inductional claims explicit.

These differences across species are currently left implicit, and it is not uncommon to find scientific abstracts that don't mention a species at all. 

Currently, the largest authority on cell type defintions, the Cell Ontology, provides "multispecies" definitions of cell types. These are conceptually important. However, labeling studies plainly with such concepts is dangerous. It is not safe to assume that a "mouse neutrophil" is simply a "neutrophil" that happens to be in a "mouse". According to the rules of logic, combinations of "multispecies" cell types and specific taxons make up new concepts. 

By providing a specific scope, we can make explicit what are currently implicit predictions. A question "Do whales lack neutrophils?" is falsifiable, and, intuitively, we would imagine that they have cells that could be classified as neutrophils. However, this question is is only falsifiable if we have a rigorous definition of "neutrophil" across its scope of taxons. Conversely, if we say that "the scope of neutrophils is mammals" we are making a strong prediction that we should find cells of this category in any mammal. If we would apply severe tests to find neutrophils and whales and recurrently fail to identify one matching cell, we would have a good reason to discuss changing our scope of neutrophils. 

Rule number 3 is a rule of practical concern. There is a massive amount of "rigorous classes" that one scientist might come up with, due to the combinatorial nature of classes, far outnumbering the reported number of atoms in the observable universe. For that reason, a criterion of usefullness is necessary for deciding when a class of cells is considered a cell type. The most fair criteria of usefulness is one based on the individual: a valid cell type is whatever class one individual rationally considers useful. 

However, we can be more rigorous in defining usefulness, if we consider rule number 4: a cell type has to be anchored to other cell types. Which means that a definition of class is of negligible usefulness if it can't be considered a "subclass" of other cell type. For our practical concerns, all imaginable cell types are subclasses of "cell of eukaryonts". 
Note that "human erithrocyte" is a cell type characterized by lack of a nucleus, so depending on your definition of "eukaryotic cell", it would exclude "human erythrocite". Anyways, this anchoring is important for integrating knowledge across studies, because eventhoug a specific "transcriptomically-defined" cell type and a "electrophyisiologically-defined" cell type cannot be rigorously said to be the same, they can be grouped in a "superclass" that contains cells that match either one or the other criteria.

The consequences of this set of criteria will be discussed further in the following sections.

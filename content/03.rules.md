# 1. A set of 4 rules for defining a cell type

Our pragmatic definition of cell type (for eukaryotic, multicellular organisms) consists of 4 simple rules (Figure @fig:rules).
A cell type is a class of cells that must be:

1. Explicitly defined
2. Identifiable for a defined taxon
3. Theoretically useful 

And that should be:

4. Ontologically related to other cell types

![ The set of 4 rules for defining a cell type.](images/four_rules_hn.jpg){#fig:rules}

Here, "must" represents an absolute requirement, whereas "should" suggests that "there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item" (as per RFC 2119 [@wikidata:Q104060055]).

For rule 1, we argue that the cell type needs to be followed by a clear definition that would allow rational judgments of whether a singular cell belongs to the type or not.
Such definitions should be complete [@wikidata:Q47303277] and provide necessary and sufficient criteria for classification. An example is a cell type defined by "expression of the proteins CD3 and CD4, but lacking CD8."
Even though there is still some ambiguity (see [@doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2725-5; @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu807] for longer discussions), it already states clear and reasonable criteria.
The degree of rigorousness cannot be decided a priori, as we still do not have a rigorous framework for representing biological knowledge, but we should strive to make definitions as rigorous as possible.
Other examples of what could be explicit definitions are as follows:

- "Big cell" is a class of cells with a length of more than 50 micrometers on any axis.
- "Human cortical neuron" is a class of cells in the human cortex that are capable of producing an action potential.
- "Leukocyte" is a class of cells found in animal blood that are achromatic.

The recognition of multiple valid characteristics to define types is not new.
The first Cell Ontology article, in 2005, explicitly acknowledged criteria based on function, histology, lineage, and ploidy. [@wikidata:Q21184168]
These features were combined in the definitions of "species-neutral" cell types, arguably useful for integrating databases or teaching biology. [@doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7]
Gradually, we acknowledge that we might need more specific classes to characterize experimental biology, leading to the definition of species-specific types defined by granular characteristics. [@doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1980-6; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6]. Thus, even though it steers away from current "gut feeling", implicit descriptions, rule 1 is essential for logical coherence when dealing with the concept in a formal setting.

Rule 2 argues for clarity on the taxa for which a given cell type is expected to manifest, i. e., its taxonomic scope.
The scope is not only a constraint (in a sense used in the Gene Ontology [@wikidata:Q33727235]); it states that the cell type needs to be discoverable in any individual of the taxa of interest, given the appropriate conditions (e.g., stage of life and biological sex). 
The definition of taxon used here is as broad as possible, and englobes to classical taxons such as strains, species and so on, but also consider different probed populations.
"Taxon" here might be any class of organisms, such as "citizens of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil" or "purple fish". 
The flexibility is necessary to fit the different populations actually probed in the real world. 
Even so, the taxonomic scope is necessary for making transparent, falsifiable statements about cell types. 

Rule 3, regarding the usefulness, deals with a practical concern.
Rigorously, there is an infinite number of explicit definitions that any scientist might come up with.
One simple proof of this infinitude is that size-based cell definitions (as for "big cell" above) may alone consider any of the infinite real numbers.
A cell type created just for its own sake is not valid: one must be able to say something meaningful about the real world by employing the concept.
The statements do not need to be true to be useful, however: a falsified hypothesis is of great value. 
As usefulness is a subjective criterion, the number of possible cell types is constrained by one's goals.
Thus, this rule is not intersubjectively appliable: no one can deny a claim of usefulness.
However, it is a principle worth keeping in mind when deciding on the resolution of cell type classification.


Rule 4 is presented as a suggestion. 
While the first 3 rules are necessary for logically coherent statements about cell types, rule 4 deals with a practical purpose.   
A cell type, if not catalogued in an ontology or a knowledge graph, will be strictly less useful for the research community.
Knowledge about that cell type would be valid, but would be floating adrift, without connection to the rest of human knowledge.

The ontological organization is not only theoretical valuable, but it is important for integrating data across studies.
It is logically impossible for a cell type defined by transcriptomics and another defined by electrophysiology to form an undivisible type. 
There are (at least) 3 types there: the ones defined by each technique, and the union of those. 
For example, the green-OFF bipolar cells of the retina and the Syt2<sup>-</sup>/NK3R<sup>+</sup> cells of the retina are considered to be the same cell type in the literature. [@wikidata:Q34307217]  
However, as response to light and gene expression are often measured separately, knowledge is produced for two different classes. 
These classes, then, can be combined in the superclass "(green-OFF) OR (Syt2<sup>-</sup>/NK3R<sup>+</sup>) cells". 

The consequences of this set of criteria will be discussed further in sections 3 and 4.

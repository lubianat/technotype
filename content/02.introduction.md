# Introduction

One of the basic classes in any undergraduate major in life sciences is the histology class. The students are tasked with identifying cel types across various tissues, looking for color and shape patterns in hematoxylin-eosin stains. The text-books, such as the one by Junqueira & Carneiro[@isbn:9788527723114], work as manuals (in the Kuhnian sense)[@isbn:9780226458113] that perpetuate the paradigms of what we know about a couple hundred cell types.

Our concept of "cell type", thus, is still based on century-old histochemical techniques -  such as the Golgi-stains of neurons immortalized by Ramon y Cajal[@doi:10.1016/j.cub.2004.06.035]. The histological influence is noticeable even in names given to cell types: "erithrocytes", "eosinophil", "basophils", "oxyphilic cell of the thyroid". The concepts we use are drawn from studies of microanatomy. The connection with anatomy leads to thinking about cell types as anatomical entities as if they were clearly dissectable and fixed in an organism. This may be the reason why attempts to quantify cell types use the scale of "hundreds" of human cell types [@https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/bionumber.aspx?id=103626] [@https://askabiologist.asu.edu/questions/human-cell-types] [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2017.03.006.].

New techniques have challenged this anatomy based conceptualization. From flow cytometry to patch clamping, to single-cell RNA-seq, we saw a burst of new categories, and novel cell "subtypes" and "families" popped up in the literature. The bursting intensified in the past few years, with the rise of projects to characterize _all_ human cell types, like the Human Cell Atlas and HUBMAP [@doi:10.7554/eLife.27041] [@pmid:31597973].

The advances in biology require us to find better answers for how to define a cell type. The concept might not have a "true" meaning, in a philosophical-realistic sense. Nevertheless, we can strive to find nominal, pragmatic definitions for the pragmatic challenges of large scale biology. Otherwise, how can we precisely label single-cell data? How can we formalize the discovery of new cell types? How can we integrate the knowledge from the millions of scientific articles published every year? 

The need for conceptual advance is perceived by the community [@pmid:28334573] [@doi:10.1242/dev.169854] [@doi:10.1242/dev.178996] [@doi:10.1038/550451a], and new perspectives are arising. One core line of thought is evolutionary: the cell type as an evolutionary unit defined by a Core Regulatory Complex (CoRC) of transcription factors. That definition enables the drawing of parallels between the evolution of other biological entities (such as genes, proteins and species) to the evolution of cell types. Models of how multicellular life works greatly benefit from concepts such as "sister types" (cell types that diverged from a single ancestor), "cell type homology," (cell types in different species that share a common evolutionary origin) and "cell type convergence" (cell types that execute similar functions, but which are not directly evolutionarily related). [@pmid:18927580] [@doi:10.1038/nrg.2016.127] 

However, as much as different concepts of species coexist [@doi:10.1080/10635150701701083], our quest to define cell types may take various forms. The challenge of representing cell types in the context of evolution is conceptually different from the challenge of representing cell types in biomedical experimentation. In that second direction,  the groundwork of the Cell Ontology [@doi:10.1186/gb-2005-6-2-r21] [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6] [@doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7] project and the International Workshop on Cells in Experimental Life Sciences[@doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1976-2] [@doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2721-9] are notable. Their contributions base much of the views here and will be discussed in detail throughout the article. 

The conceptual quest addressed by this work is one of the research synthesis and is summarized in the following question: which cell type definition can be crafted for rigorously describing biomedical experiments?

For that goal, the body of the article is divided in 4 parts. In Part 1, we will bring a proposal of a set of rules that are sufficient for defining  cell types. In Part 2, we will propose a small set of names for differentiating main classes of cell types. In Part 3, we will address the logical consequences of the proposed definitions. And in Part 4, we will discuss the pragmatic challenges for employing such definitions.

# Practical consequences of the definition of a cell type


In the previous section, we discussed the logical entailments of accepting the proposed rules as valid. Here, we extend the pragmatic considerations on using such a system for real-world applications.
In a recent attempt to define cell types for single cell RNA-Seq, Aevermann et al came up with a set of needs: “The minimum set of necessary and sufficient marker genes selectively expressed by the cell type”, “A parent cell class in the CL (Cell Ontology)”, and “A specimen source description (anatomic structure þ species)”.
[@pmid:29590361] Their approach has great merit in defining clear guidelines for marking a cell type. The requirement of markers is reasonable for the field of single-cell RNA-seq, where marker information is abundant. The Cell Ontology has used markers for defining cell types, an approach employed in particular for immune cells [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6] [@doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2725-5] [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu807].   

The use of markers, however, leaves us with a conceptual problem – definitions of cell type used by electrophysiologists, or even in the manuals of histology classes, are not based on markers. Rigorously adopted, this requirement would leave aside an entire segment of what we consider biomedical knowledge. Moreover, gene markers are not defined for cell types that span multiple species, a problem already discussed in the Cell Ontology report of 2011 [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6].

By using our less stringent set of rules, we can better evaluate claims of discovery of new cell types. With vast amounts of data and loose definition of cell types, it becomes uncannily easy to claim a new cell type. Conversely, if one explicitly claims to have discovered a new sensu stricto cell type, one has to provide enough evidence that cells from this class are identifiable across all individuals of a species. A claim of an archetype would require evidence of existence in more than one species. Consequently, experiments that only use a specific strain of mice have a more robust claim if the expectation is limited to the infratype.

An example of the discovery of a new archetype is the pair of articles published in Nature in 2018 [@doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0393-7] [@doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0394-6] about the newly found “ionocyte”, a class of cells in the trachea enriched for the expression of genes homologous to the CFTR gene. Both studies displayed evidence for such a class in both mouse and human samples, corroborating the existence of an archetype. This discovery of an archetype has been denominated by both articles as a discovery of a new cell type.

Another example of cell type discovery is found in a pioneering article by Villani et al [@doi:10.1126/science.aah4573]. The authors describe subclasses of monocytes and dendritic cells in humans and pragmatically uses markers for their definition. The patients were recruited from “the Boston-based PhenoGenetic project (…) and the Newcastle community.” Arguably, they did not have a random sample of humanity, and the observed results might not hold for different populations. This discovery of infratypes has also been described as the discovery of a new cell type.


An example from the article is the discovery of the “AXL+ SIGLEC6+ AS Dendritic cell”. This and other cell types are presented in the article as part of a “Human dendritic cell atlas”, generalizing the theory for the whole of humanity. The jump from technotype (which takes into consideration also descriptors like “healthy” and “age between 25 and 40 years”) to infratype (“all humans in this population scope”) to cell type _sensu stricto_ (all humans) is depicted in Figure @fig:villani and exemplifies the logical flow.

“Dendritic cells” are one of the cell types most thoroughly modeled by the Cell Ontology. [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-10-70] [@doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2010.01.006] The current definition of the dendritic cell ([CL_0000451](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000451)) is coupled to the leukocyte ([CL_0000738](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000738)). Leukocytes are defined as   These definitions are not reconcilable to the "dendritic cells" studied by Villani et al's. We have no way of knowing if the cells in their work are "typically resident in particular tissues", “achromatic cell of the myeloid or lymphoid lineages capable of ameboid movement.” These definitions are not reconcilable with the “dendritic cells” studied by Villani et al. We have no way of knowing if the cells in their work are achromatic or capable of ameboid movement. That might sound pedantic and might, unfortunately, be so, but the logical requirements of computational systems lead to both biocurators and computers being seen as pedantic. This high level of precision is necessary to accurately depict not only the complexities of cell types but also of research settings.


![ Conceptualization of a set of the cell types in Villani et al, 2017 [@doi:10.1126/science.aah4573]. The depicted cell types were manually curated from the article, where they are either implicitly or explicitly mentioned. The set of cell types is not comprehensive, and represent only a small fraction of the concepts handled by the authors. Identifiers for cell types are written in pseudocode based on the Turtle serialization for RDF knowledge graphs (https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) and represent valid URIs (described in the database https://celltypes.wiki.opencura.com/wiki/Main_Page). URI: Universal Resource Identifier; RDF: Resource Description Framework.](images/villani_asdcs.png  ){#fig:villani}


Even if we are not yet able to formally represent all the aspects that go into a cell type definition, we can use an explicit "natural language definition" property to define cell types. As David Osumi-Sutherland puts in his 2017 article about cell type classification, there is a "_mismatch between quantified logic, which records assertions about all members of a class, and the messy, noisy reality of biology and the data we collect about it._." [@doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1980-6]. We do not need to have all the biology classified before we deal with cell types. Taking the example in Figure @fig:villani, all cell types treated as “dendritic cells” in the literature are valid subclasses of the dendritic cell archetype (ct:Q20). Such a subclassing system might lack the power to computationally check the validity of definitions. However, by the principle of minimal commitment [@wikidata:Q47303277], it could already be a suitable scaffold for representing experimental data (e.g., from single-cell transcriptomics) and may allow logically robust data integration.

However, a new problem arises. How to name all these specific cell types? How to humanely comprehend so many cell types with such subtle differences? Which names should we use to differentiate cells that were selected by slightly different combinations of markers?

For accurately classifying cell types from the perspective of research synthesis, we need explicit definitions, and they should be as rigorous as possible. This makes the task of finding common names especially hard. We avoid this challenge, focusing on the identification of computationally useful concepts. Common names can be agreed upon in a context by referencing identifiers as with regard to the common and scientific names of species.
  

Sabina Leonelli stated that the challenges thrown up by big data in biology require advancement of our philosophical theories [@doi:10.7554/eLife.47381]. We agree and argue that the converse is also true: to advance the theoretical foundations of modern biology, we need to harness the power of computational tools. Computational ontologies provide a solution for dealing with complex concepts. Classes in ontologies can have alpha-numeric identifiers. We can, thus, assign each technotype a Unique Resource Identifier, a URI, similar to the Cell Ontology (CL) [@doi:10.1186/gb-2005-6-2-r21] [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-6] [@doi:10.1186/s13326-016-0088-7] or Wikidata [@doi:10.7554/eLife.52614] [@https://www.wikidata.org/]. The quest for naming cell types becomes simpler when the goal does not require human readability at every step. Instead, by harnessing computer power to record the identifiers and their explicit definitions, we can focus on higher-level abstractions. 


The idea of “technotype” can theoretically solve issues with labeling cell types in single-cell experiments. The non-existence of exact matches in CL (even when combined with other ontologies) renders it theoretically impossible to annotate articles and datasets with perfection. The “technotype” avoids that imprecision by giving power to every researcher to craft their “cell type” of interest. As mentioned in the previous section, by having knowledge that connect the concepts, we would still be able to compare results from different researchers by explicitly stating the level of abstraction at which they can be compared.

Specifically, for single-cell transcriptomics, the technotype refines our model for labeling cells (and, consequently, cell clusters). A branch of computational single-cell development has dedicated itself to find tools for labeling single-cell experiments. While some approaches ignore ontologies [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkz543] [@doi:10.1101/2020.01.05.895441], others aim at finding the best class among the Cell Ontology [@https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ontoProc/inst/doc/ontoProc.html#conceptual-overview-of-ontology-with-cell-types] or MeSH IDs[@doi:10.1101/2020.05.29.124743] [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17281-7]. Manual matches have been fed to algorithms such as BLAST2CO [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17281-7] to predict best "matches" for a single-cell cluster. However, unless the cells were sampled in the same way across articles, and drawn at random from the same population of individuals, they represent strictly different classes, even if very similar. Thus, we must change the task from finding a "match" to the cells in a given current experiment to finding a  "point of insertion" in an ontological network. By acknowledging these real differences, we can have precise metadata, enabling precise statements and facilitating valid reuse of publically available data.

## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The concept of cell type is key for modeling biology. Recent technological advances are prompting us to rethink what we understand by cell type and how we classify them. There is currently no consensus in the definition of a cell type, which makes it hard to integrate knowledge across life sciences. We propose here that a cell type should represent any class of cell that is explicitly defined; is identifiable within a taxon; and is theoretically useful. We also specified four classes of cell types: sensu stricto cell types (to differentiate the concepts applied to a single species), archetypes (from the ones for multiple species), infratypes (populations below the species level), and technotypes (specific experiments). The flexible and rigorous framework we propose can base annotation of single-cell omics data sets, and reconcile knowledge about cells across all different domains of science
